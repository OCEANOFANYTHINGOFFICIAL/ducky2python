# ducky2python :snake:
Convert DuckyScript scripts (of the hak5 USB Rubber Ducky) to Python programs that can run on your computer without a rubber ducky.<br /><br />
Why DuckyScript and why Python? It's easy! DuckyScript is simple and easy to learn and has become a standard in the BadUSB and pentesting community, Python also is easy to be written and is arguably one of the most portable programming languages available. Combine the two using ducky2python and you have a really easy to learn and powerfull automation tool in your hands!

 :star: UPDATE: Now ducky2python has a website which you can use instead of downloading and running the Python program! See instructions bellow.

1. Visit https://oceanofanythingofficial.github.io/ducky2python
2. Paste & Convert your script
3. Copy and paste the converted script to a text editor and save the file with a .py extension
